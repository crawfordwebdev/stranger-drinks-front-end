This is the main landing page of our application.  It has a nav bar at the top where you have the options to mix your drink, if that drink does not have the ingredient you want you can add it via the add ingredient section. It has a drinks section that allows you to view all the drinks the user has created and a profile section that allows you to view all other visitors on the app.

The mix drink section will have a form for you to enter.  The name of the drink (which is required) and the list of ingredients for you to chose from that has been pre-added to our database.  If you do not see an ingredient you like, you can always create on new one by clicking the add ingredient button at the top of the nav-bar. Once you have created your drink it'll take you to the all drinks page. Which is listed below.

This is your main drinks page where you can edit, delete, or head to the details page where you can write a review on your creation. Enjoy!

## Next Steps:
<p> We plan on implementing more into the profile.  We want to be able to add a Hangover tip that has full CRUD functionality. So each user can view other user's tip and be able to create their own</p>
<p> We also wanted to implement a bar component where users can go to a different screen and be able to have all the ingredients shown.  From their they would be able to click and ingredient and measurement and be able to put together their own drink.</p>
<p> We also want to implement a BAC calculator that might live on the review page.  This feature would be able to calculate your BAC based on the measurements and the strength of ingredients you chose.</p>
<p> Add an admin function for the add ingredient feature.</p>
